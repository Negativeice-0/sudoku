# sudoku
Here is soduko 3 with a revised version of your code that includes an advanced backtracking algorithm and input validation.
This version of the code includes a function isValidInput that checks if the input string is valid (i.e., contains only â€˜1â€™-â€˜9â€™ or â€˜.â€™). If the input is invalid, the program prints an error message and returns. The Sudoku solving algorithm is the same as before. It uses a simple backtracking algorithm, which may not be the most efficient method for large or difficult puzzles. There are more advanced algorithms for solving Sudoku puzzles that you might want to explore12. I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

An attempt at optimisation, feel free to figure out where to place it and play around with it to see which you fancy most.

// solve tries to fill the board with valid numbers and returns true if successful.
func solve(board [][]rune) bool {
 // Find the next empty cell with the fewest possibilities in the board.
 i, j, found := findEmptyWithFewestPossibilities(board)
 // If no empty cell is found, the board is solved.

 // Try each possible number for the empty cell.
 for _, num := range getPossibleNumbers(board, i, j) {
  // Place the number in the cell.
  board[i][j] = num
  // Recursively try to solve the rest of the board.
  if solve(board) {
   return true
  }
  // Undo the number if it leads to a dead end.
  board[i][j] = '.'
 }
 // Return false if no number works for the cell.
 return false
}

// findEmptyWithFewestPossibilities returns the row, column, and a boolean flag of the next empty cell with the fewest possibilities in the board.
func findEmptyWithFewestPossibilities(board [][]rune) (int, int, bool) {
 minPossibilities := 10
 var minI, minJ int
 found := false
 // Loop through the rows and columns of the board.
 for i := 0; i < rows; i++ {
  for j := 0; j < cols; j++ {
   // If the cell is empty, check the number of possibilities.
   if board[i][j] == '.' {
    possibilities := getPossibleNumbers(board, i, j)
    if len(possibilities) < minPossibilities {
     minPossibilities = len(possibilities)
     minI = i
     minJ = j
     found = true
    }
   }
  }

 // Return the coordinates and true if an empty cell is found, otherwise return zero values and false.

The provided code is a Sudoku solver written in Go. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how it works:

1. **Main Function**: The `main` function initializes an empty 9x9 Sudoku board and reads the Sudoku puzzle from the command line. Each row of the puzzle is entered as a string of 9 characters, using '.' for empty cells. If the input is invalid, the program prints an error message and returns. Then, it attempts to solve the board and prints the result.

2. **Solve Function**: The `solve` function is a recursive function that tries to fill the board with valid numbers. It finds the next empty cell with the fewest possibilities and tries each possible number for that cell. If a number is valid for the cell, it places the number in the cell and recursively tries to solve the rest of the board. If no number works for the cell, it undoes the number and returns false.

3. **FindEmptyWithFewestPossibilities Function**: This function returns the row, column, and a boolean flag of the next empty cell with the fewest possibilities in the board. It loops through the rows and columns of the board, and if a cell is empty, it checks the number of possibilities for that cell. It returns the coordinates of the cell with the fewest possibilities.

4. **GetPossibleNumbers Function**: This function returns a slice of possible numbers for a cell. It tries each number from 1 to 9, and if a number is valid for the cell, it adds the number to the slice.

5. **Valid Function**: This function checks if placing a number in a cell is valid according to the Sudoku rules. It checks the row and column of the cell, and if the number already exists in the row or column, it returns false. It also checks the subgrid of the cell, and if the number already exists in the subgrid, it returns false. If the number is valid for the cell, it returns true.

6. **Print Function**: This function prints the board to the standard output. It prints a newline after every third row and a space after every third column.

7. **IsValidInput Function**: This function checks if the input string is valid (i.e., contains only '1'-'9' or '.'). If the input is invalid, it returns false.

This Sudoku solver uses a more advanced algorithm than simple backtracking. It reduces the search space by choosing the empty cell with the fewest possibilities and trying each possible number for that cell. This approach can significantly improve the efficiency of the solver. However, please note that these optimizations may not always lead to a noticeable improvement in performance, especially for easy puzzles that can be solved quickly even with a simple backtracking algorithm. For more advanced algorithms, you might want to explore constraint programming or other techniques. I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions. ðŸ˜Š
